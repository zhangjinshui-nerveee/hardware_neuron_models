<h2> Analog and Digital Hardware Neural Models </h2>
<p>

<b>Introduction</b> 
</p><p>We needed hardware neural models for teaching neurobiology and electronics. We wanted models at at least two different levels:
</p><ul>
  <li>Integrate and Fire digital neurons which emphisize simple dynamics and can be connected together to form larger systems.</li>
  <li>Conductance-level neuron models which use analog techniques to simulate the dynamics of individual cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>The circuits below were simulated in Electronics Workbench and will be built as hardware models for students.<b> </b></p>
<hr>
<p><b>Analog conductance-level circuit</b>s 
</p><p>Maeda and Makino (1) show how to model a neuron using 3 
transistors for a  FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) type neuron (simplified from 
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation). The FitzHugh-Nagumo scheme replaces the 
fast Na current of the HH model with a simplified fast, depolarizing, 
activation process, and replaces the slow Na inactivation and slow, 
repolarizing, K current  by a single slow inactivation process. By 
adding one more repolarizing process, modeled by two more transistors,  
they can produce a neuron with bursting behavior.
</p><p>The circuit is show below for the  FHN neuron. The circuit 
produces a constant train of simulated action potentials (AP) when a 
constant current is applied. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/neuron2.ewb">here</a>.
 Note that the amplitude of the simulated action potential is much 
larger than that of a physiological neuron. Simulated AP amplitude is 
around 5 volts, while in real life the AP amplitude is around 100 mV. </p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/FHN1circuit.png" width="929" height="618">
</p><hr>
  <p>The neuron can be made to oscillate without an external current 
source by adding RL shown below. The resistor acts as an inward current 
leak. The usefulll range of RL is about 25 kohms (fast oscillation) to 
around 250 kohms.

  </p><hr>
<p>It is easy to voltage clamp these model neurons. The image below 
shows a 3 volt step applied from resting potential. A transient inward 
current is seen, followed by an outward current. <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/n2clamp.ewb">EWB file</a>.

</p><hr>
<p>The circuit is show below for the FHN neuron, extended with an extra 
conductance process. The circuit produces a constant train of simulated 
AP bursts when a constant current is applied.
  The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/neuron1.ewb">here</a>. 
</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/FHNburstCircuit.png" width="937" height="658">
</p><hr>
<p>Maeda, Yagi, and Makino (2) extend the model to include heart cells. 
They slightly modified one of the repolarizing processes to make a 
plateau potential. The circuit show below shows two traces. The bottom 
trace is membrane potential, the top is the deritivive, which is a 
simple approximation of an ECG. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/heartcell.ewb">here</a>. Be sure to set the integration method to <code>Gear</code> in the menu item <br>
  <code>Analysis...Analysis Options...Transient</code>. The example below uses the default <code>trapzoidal</code> method, which causes spurious oscillations. 
</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/HeartCellcircuit.png" width="894" height="606">
</p><hr>
<p>By turning one of the neurons into a macro (FHNbuild below), we can 
build an axon to investigate extracellular versus intracellular 
recording. The 50 kohm resistors model the axonal lumen. The 100 ohm 
resistors model the bath saline. The subtractor just below the axon 
simulates a perfect differential amplifier. Note that the voltage scale 
on the bottom (extracellular) trace is 100 times more sensitive than the
 top trace. The specific model built is decribed below in the <em>Construction</em> section. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/n2axon.ewb">here</a>. 

</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/FHNaxon.png" width="1145" height="674">
</p><p>As few as 3 sections, terminated with a passive load, can be used as a teaching model.

</p><hr>
<p>The basic FHN models don't have an explicit sodium inactivation, but 
for teaching voltage clamp techniques, it would be nice to have this 
process represented. The following circuit uses an RC combination on the
 power supply to the fast inward current to limit the current to a short
 burst. The length of the burst is determined by the size of the 
capacitor, here 1uf, and the membrane resistance. The refractory period 
is determined by the RC time constant, here 20 mSec. In clamp mode, if 
you change the 620 ohm resistor in either the fast inward or delayed 
outward current to 1 Mohm, then that current is essentially eliminated, 
simulating a selective block of the approriate channel. The two 
currrents can thus be seen separately. <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/n2nahclamp.ewb">Workbench file</a>. <br>

<p><strong>Conductance Models based on Guy Roy's <em>NeuroFET</em></strong> (3) </p>
<p>These models use analog computation, combined with N-channel, 
enhancement-mode, field-effect transistors, to simulate conductance 
changes in the membrane. The circuit is scaled so that the timing and 
magnitude of the conductance changes (and voltage changes) are 
biologically realistic. The battery V1 sets the leakage through Na 
channels at resting potential. A more positive value stabilizes the 
membrane, while more negative can cause oscillations. <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/fet3.ewb">Electronics Workbench file</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Model Synapses</strong>
</p><p>Modifying the depolarizing process channel to depend on 
presynaptic voltage (and changing the reveral potential) makes an 
excitatory synapse. Top trace is the presynaptic cell. Bottom trace 
shows postsynaptic cell with EPSP and AP. The diode in the synapse 
represents the isolation of the presynaptic side due to transmitter 
release. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/neuron2excite.ewb">here</a>. 
</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/FHN2excite.png" width="1173" height="646">
</p><hr>
<p>Modifying the repolarizing process channel to depend on presynaptic 
voltage  makes an inhibitory synapse. Top trace is the presynaptic cell.
 Bottom trace shows postsynaptic cell with IPSP and AP. Note that this 
inhibitory synapse exhibits shunting as well as hyperpolarization. The 
Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/neuron2inhib.ewb">here</a>.

</p><hr>
<p>A burster cell was turned into a macro, then two of them were 
connected through inhibitory synapses. By adjusting the strength and 
time constant of the synapse, you can get alternate bursting. 
The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/twoburster.ewb">here</a>.

</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/TwoBurster.png" width="757" height="604"> 
</p><hr>
<p>With four bursters, connected as two sets of alternate bursters, you 
can get 2:1 locking by adding an excitatory synapse between the two 
sets. The faster set was adjusted to have a natural burst rate just 
slightly slower than 2:1 lock. The excitatory synapse adds a little 
extra current to lock the frequency. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/fourburster.ewb">here</a>.

<img src="Model%20Neurons_files/FburstMacro.png" width="699" height="490">
</p><hr>
<p>Adding a diode and resistors between the two cells results in an 
electrotonic connection with a stronger connection from left to right. 
The traces show a very complex interaction between the two cells. 
  Note that any given electrotonic synapse can be rectifying in either 
direction, or not at all. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/neuron2electro.ewb">here</a>.

<p><b>Integrate-and-fire circuit</b>s 
</p><p>The circuit below uses monostables (e.g. 74HC123) as integrate 
and fire (IF) neurons. The Q output is the AP pulse. The W output is an 
inverted AP pulse. The diode to the W output discharges simulated 
membrane capacitance when an AP occurs. The 25k/0.1 uF components 
attached to RT/CT and CT inputs set the length of the AP pulse. The 
neuron on the left is driving the neuron on the right with an excitatory
 connection. 
The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/ifv4.ewb">here</a>.

</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/IFexcite.png" width="865" height="587">
</p><hr>
<p>The circuit below connects 2 IF neurons with an inhibitory synapse. 
The monostable was added to stretch the pulse and invert it. A better 
version of an excitatory synapse (than the one shown above) would be to 
use the Q output of the synaptic monostable as the input to the second 
cell through a diode which allows current to from from the Q terminal to
 the second cell's input capacitor. The Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/ifv4inhib.ewb">here</a>.

</p><p><img src="Model%20Neurons_files/IFinhib.png" width="943" height="569">
</p><hr>
<p>The following circuit implements a IF burster by using a second 
monostable to inhibit the first one. The top two monostables are the 
burster. The bottom monostable is an weakly inhibited non-burster. The 
Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/ifburstv5.ewb">here</a>.

<p><strong>Construction</strong>
</p><p>To actually build one of the Maeda neurons, it is handy to 
simplify the power supplies so that only one battery is needed. 
Elimanating the simulated potassium battery required changing the sodium
 current threshold by adding a diode. The battery voltage was changed to
 6 volts to make it easier to use lithium batteries. The RL resistor 
allows the circuit to act as a pacemaker. Replacing RL with a CdS 
photoresistor makes a photosensor with output frequency related to light
 intensity. Lower resistance is a faster pacer. The userful range of RL 
is about 25 kohm to 450 kohm. The expanded simulated scope image should 
be compared with the photograph of the real scope screen. The 
Electronics Workbench file is <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/n2build.ewb">here</a>. A picture of the white board prototype is included below.

</p><p>A first hack at a curcuit board is shown below. Transistors are 
(from left to right) 2N3904, 2N3906, 2N3904. The diode is a 1N914. A 
battery holder is mounted on the back of the board. the two vias on the 
left side of the board are the only two connections to the outside 
world. Top left is <em>inside</em> the cell, bottom left is <em>outside</em>. The resistor marked <code>***</code> sets the pacemaker rate. Omitting this resistor makes the circuit more like a squid axon element. <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/PROJECTS/NeuralModels/FHN.pcb">ExpressPCB file</a>.
